### Our Vision
Our vision is to create an webapp that helps people find the perfect place to live and the perfect roommate in any city or location. The app will allow users to search for properties and flats according to their budget and preferences, as well as match them with potential roommates based on their interests and lifestyle. It also predicts the rent based on the data provided by the property owner. We believe that this webapp will revolutionize the way people find places to live and make it easier to find the perfect flat and flatmate.
